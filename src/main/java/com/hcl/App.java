 * Hello world! We need to build a calculator based Command line app where for
 * each operation, it should take 2 numbers and either add, substract, multiply
 * and divide, add
 * 
 * The based application involves prompting the user for 2 number and implement
 * only add
 * 
 * You have to have a menu driven application, where it show a banner and it
 * show "add, substract, multiply, divide" and if you select add or substract,
 * it should prompt for 2 number and the op and do the operation and show the
 * results and keep prompting the user with the same menu.
 * 
 * the 2 key requirement is it should have a basic banner and it should also be
 * menu driven
